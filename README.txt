Reflection for README Project Three
•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    o	This project was a grocery tracking app that tracked the number of items purchased in a store on a given day.  It would help with inventory by solving a variety of problems, such as identifying how many of each item was purchased, searching for a specific item and returning how many were purchased, and providing a graphical depiction of all items and quantities purchased as well.
•	What did you do particularly well?
    o	I feel that I did a decent job overall with getting the code to perform as desired without adding too much complexity.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    o	My input validation and error catching could certainly be spruced up, as I know there are some issues with the file-handling that I would like to improve if I were to continue on this.  I could also spend more time making the UI more unique.
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    o	The histogram was probably the most difficult part, because there were so many moving parts (reading file and creating new file in Python, reading new file in C++, printing output including changing number to graphical depiction of quantity).  I spent a lot of time exploring various resources on the web, such as StackOverflow and YouTube to see similar problems and how they were solved to get inspiration.  I also used several more generic resources to make sure I understood various concepts well in order to get a working solution.  All of the above resources were already in my support network, but I did feel that I was growing in fluency on how to search for them – this tripped me up far less than other projects (of smaller scale even) have before, so I felt hopeful from that. 
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    o	So many aspects, of course, but I think that the file-handling, the OOP concepts, and the practice with combining multiple languages into one project are all invaluable skills that I was not comfortable with prior to this.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    o	I think that thorough commenting did the most to make this maintainable, readable, and adaptable.  Even if I discover a better method of solving an aspect of the code, I should easily be able to identify what is currently handling that and work to install the new solution.  Similarly, if a different/new need is added, I have a solid groundwork to build upon.
